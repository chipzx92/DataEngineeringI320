# Data Transformations

We can represent the same data in many different ways.  

I don't mean file formats like Excel, XML, or CSV.  I mean different ways of laying out the data within those files.

In this exercise you have found a bunch of files on a shared server, all about students and their hobbies over the years.  Your task is to merge them all together into a single file.

## The files

You can download a zip of the files using this link.

### filename: 2011-hobbies.csv

```
Shuyen, dancing; skating
Ravi, dancing; skiing
Diane, skating
```

### filename: 2010-hobbies.csv

```
skaters, Daewon, Desmond, Sarah
dancers, Bruce, Princess
```

### filename: 2009-records/skaters-new.csv
folder: 
Alvin
Reg
Jin

### filename: 2009-records/dancers.csv
Micah
Xiao

### filename: Aishwarya.csv
2009,dancing
2010,dancing
2011,dancing & skating

## Desired output file

Your task is to merge all the facts in the files above into one single file

### filename: all_hobbies.xlsx

```
year, person_name, hobby
```


## Additional reading

We will discuss various ways that data can be organized within files and in databases throughout the semester.  You can read more about this in this paper:
