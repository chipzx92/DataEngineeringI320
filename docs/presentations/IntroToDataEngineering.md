# Data Engineering  
## A Brief Overview  

### Introduction  
What is Data Engineering?  
What Do Data Engineers Do?  
What Are Their Roles In An Organization?  
Why Is Data Engineering Important?  
What Do Data Engineers Build?  

### What Is Data Engineering
##### And Why Does It Matter?
* Data Engineering is the process of taking raw data and cleaning it, transforming it, analyzing it, 
and publishing it to make it meaningful and useful to people and organizations. 
* Our customer base as data engineers is, well, just about everyone…
* Which means that the veracity, quality, availability, and accessibility of our data is absolutely 
critical.

### "Raw Data"
##### Where Does It Come From?
* Consumer software systems (Tiktok, Spotify, Amazon)  
* Internal systems (Salesforce, CRM, Accounting, HR, etc. )  
* Internal business users (Excel spreadsheets)  
* IoT devices (solar panels, automobiles, cell phones)  
* And everything else you can think of…  

### What Do Data Engineers Do?
* They build the systems that transform raw data into meaningful and useful information.
* They do this by building:
    * Pipelines that transform data.  
    * Analytics that extract meaning from data.  
    * Reports that summarize data.  
    * Visualizations that present data.  

### Are Data Engineers In Demand?
* Data Engineer was the fastest growing tech job in 2019, growing by 50% YoY (Dice Tech Jobs Report).

> “The incentive to invest in these jobs is strong, as there is gold in the data - from more timely 
> and effective data-driven strategy and decision-making to data productization, which opens up new 
> growth and revenue centers”

* $106,000 was median salary for Level 1 data engineers (Information Week) in 2019. 
* Dice Tech Jobs report average salary for data engineers is $117,295, $128,835 average for data  
architects.

### Data Engineering Roles
##### An Ever-Expanding List
* Data Engineer as infrastructure engineer (data engineering + devOps = dataOps)
* Data Engineer as software engineer (“data intensive” systems)
* Data Engineer as data scientist
* Data Engineer as analytics engineer 
* Data Engineer as knowledge engineer

### "Data Is The New Oil"
##### Hype vs Reality
* “Big Data” - Web 2.0
* By 2025, the amount of data generated each day will reach 463 exabytes globally.
* What do we do with all that raw data?
> “The value of data has become so widely recognized, it won’t be long before it’s listed as an 
> asset on a company’s financials”

### How Is Data Like Oil?
*It has to be refined to be useful*
> Data is the new Oil. It is only valuable if we can extract the meaning from it

### Data Pipelines
##### Transform Data Into Information
* Pipelines are sequences of tasks that combine raw source data and transform it into useful information
* Pipelines have the following stages:
    * Ingestion
    * Cleaning and Validation
    * Analysis and Transformation
    * Publication/Presentation

### The Modern Data Stack (MDS)
##### This Year's Model
* The MDS is a collection of platforms, tools and technologies for delivering, managing, and 
* analyzing data.
* We will use some of those tools in this course, like DBT and Superset.

### Summary
We discussed:
* What Data Engineering is.
* What Data Engineers do.
* What roles Data Engineers have in an organization.
* How much demand there is for Data Engineers.
We discussed the analogy of “Data is the new Oil”
* Like oil, data has to be refined to be useful.
* We build “pipelines” to refine our data 
* These pipelines have several distinct stages:
    * Ingestion from source systems
    * Cleaning and validation
    * Analysis and transformation
    * Publication and presentation
* We build our pipelines using platforms, tools, and technologies of the Modern Data Stack
