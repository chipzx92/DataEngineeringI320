# Accessing Your AWS VM Environment

We have a single large AWS VM that everyone will have their own separate environment on. Superset
and Jupyter are installed as your primary software tools.

* Your login will be your EID (e.g., `abc987`)
* Your password will be your EID followed by 4 random alphanumeric characters (e.g., `abc987df4g`)
* The login and password should have been provided to you in an email.

## Login to Superset

Enter the URL for Superset in your browser: `superset.dei320.net`

You will see a login screen - enter your EID and your password. Save your EID and password to your
browser's password manager (or other password manager) if you can, so you don't have to enter it
every time.

You'll see an empty dashboard screen the first time you log in - this is fine.
