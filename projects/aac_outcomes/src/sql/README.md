Create SQL scripts for your project that do the following:
1. Create a new database for your project.
2. Create a user with read and write privileges for your project.
3. Create 2 schemas in that database - one for the data copied from the CSV files, one for your analytics tables.
4. Create the tables to import data from the csv files.

You can use the sql scripts in the music_festival project as templates/examples.
